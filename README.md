## About Project Euler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of challenging 
computational problems meant to be solved with computer programs. These 
problems range from simple to complex and cover a wide range of mathematical 
and computational topics. As you progress through the problems, you'll have 
the opportunity to improve your problem-solving skills and programming 
knowledge.

## Problem Solutions

In this repository, you'll find solutions to Project Euler problems 
implemented in different programming languages. Each problem is solved in its 
own directory, organized by problem number. Inside each E directory are 
subdirectories of the different languages that have been used to solve the 
problems. You can explore and learn from various programming approaches used to 
solve these problems. Feel welcome to reach out or discuss in theClubhou.se 
discord server. See contact options in theClubhou.se about section.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

### Fork and Clone
Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/theClubhouse-Augusta/project-euler) into
your Github repositories.

Then, clone that repository to your computer to start solving.
 ```console
git clone https://github.com/your_username/project-euler.git
```
### Install all necessary dependencies for the script:
```console
npm install 
```
### Solve an Euler
Run this command to set up the directory for whatever Euler command
you are trying to solve. This command will create a directory for you 
and a `README.md` file for your solution.
```console
npm run euler 1 javascript
```
The above command will create all the correct folders inside 
`eulers/e1/javascript/blister` and will create a `README.md` file for you
to write about your solution.
### Submit PR to theClubhouse-Augusta/project-euler
When you are happy with your solution, submit a Pull Request to the 
primary GitHub repository for [theClubhouse-Augusta](theClubhouse-Augusta/project-euler)
