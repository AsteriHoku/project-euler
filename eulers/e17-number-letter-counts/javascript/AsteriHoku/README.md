# AsteriHoku's Euler Solution 17 [javascript
This is the solution for @AsteriHoku. 

## Problem Description
If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in total.

If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used? 

  
**NOTE:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three hundred and forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred and fifteen) contains $20$ letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

## Write up from the writer:
NOTE this one is a little wild and crazy, I'm not sure the state I left it in, 
but wanted to port it into theClubhou.se eulers anyway
