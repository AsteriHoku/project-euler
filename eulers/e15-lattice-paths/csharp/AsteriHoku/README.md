## Euler Solution in csharp
https://projecteuler.net/problem=15 

This is the Project Euler solution for [15. Lattice Paths](https://projecteuler.net/problem=15)
written by AsteriHoku in csharp.

## Problem Description
Starting in the top left corner of a $2 \\times 2$ grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly $6$ routes to the bottom right corner.
